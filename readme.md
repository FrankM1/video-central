# Video Central for WordPress

Video Central allows you to import and present videos on your website from various sources such as Youtube, Vimeo or upload and host your own videos.

This plugin borrows from the code structure and philosophy found in popular plugins such as bbPress and BuddyPress meaning it is very customizable, extendable and integrates nicely with any WordPress installation. The plugin gives you the ability to create a layout or theme just the way you like it.
